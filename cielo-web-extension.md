Compatible with EVM and Solana addresses, the [Cielo extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cielo/nbmknhhenedcdaodehlbpfanpmgkjaeg) makes it easy to add wallets without interrupting your web browsing. The extension is free to use and works with your existing Cielo account. So long as you’re signed in to Cielo, the extension will import wallet addresses in one click. In the Cielo web app, you can then assign a wallet label and add it to a list if desired.
