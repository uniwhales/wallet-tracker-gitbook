# Adding to groups + channels

You can add the Cielo Wallet Tracker to any Telegram group you’re a member of (provided you have admin rights).

There are many reasons why this might be desirable:

* **NFTs**: If you’re flipping JPEGs with frens, add the bot to your group for notifications on major sales, floors, and influencer mints
* **DeFi communities**: Keep track of investor unlocks, foundation funds, treasury transactions and high value swaps for projects you’re involved with
* **Bull/bear signals**: Monitor major buy, sell, volume, and liquidity changes for tokens to gauge the mood of the markets
* **Memecoin trading**: Unsure if a newly created token is the next SHIB or shitcoin? Add the contract address to your bot and monitor where it goes from there
* **Ecosystem tracking**: Enter the addresses of major endpoints in one of the networks Cielo tracks and follow the money as it moves through bridges, DEXs, and lending protocols

### Adding to a group

To add the bot to a group you're a member of, click the blue menu icon in the [Cielo Wallet Tracker](https://t.me/EVMTrackerbot) channel and select _/main_.
