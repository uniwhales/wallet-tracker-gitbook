# Getting started: Telegram

It's recommended that you use the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot in conjunction with the Cielo [web app](https://app.cielo.finance). The app is free to use and its GUI makes it easy to adjust wallet settings. If you'd rather just use the Telegram bot without the web app, however, read on.

To initialize the [Cielo Wallet Tracker bot](https://t.me/evmtrackerbot), open it in Telegram and press the blue **Start** button.

Four options are displayed:

* **Add wallet or token**: Input the address and label for a wallet you wish to track or the smart contracxt address for a token.
* **List**: View all of the wallets that you're currently tracking. You can then click on the edit option beside each wallet to adjust its settings.
* **Menu**: View master menu that includes options for setting group and channel alerts.
* **Bot settings**: Opens options to disable bot or reset chat.



### Adding a wallet

To add a wallet using the Telegram bot, click the blue menu icon followed by the top option that appears: **Add new wallet or token**.

Then click the **Wallet** button and paste in the wallet address followed by a space and then an optional name for the wallet e.g. _My Trading Wallet_. By default, all of the chains that Cielo tracks are enabled. If you wish to disable alerts for any of these chains, just click the relevant button to disable the selection.
