# Getting started: Telegram

It's recommended that you use the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot in conjunction with the Cielo [web app](https://app.cielo.finance). The app is free to use and its GUI makes it easy to adjust wallet settings. If you'd rather just use the Telegram bot without the web app, however, read on.

To initialize the [Cielo Wallet Tracker bot](https://t.me/evmtrackerbot), open it in Telegram and press the blue **Start** button.

* **List**: View all of the wallets that you're currently tracking. You can then click on the edit option beside each wallet to adjust its settings.
* **Menu**: View master menu that includes options for setting group and channel alerts.
* **Bot settings**: Opens options to disable bot or reset chat.
