# Supported transactions



By default, the Cielo Wallet Tracker provides alerts for four primary transaction types: _swap, transfer, LP,_ and _NFT transfer_. This covers the most common tx types that occur onchain. If you wish to disable alerts for certain transaction types, you can do so via the web app (paid plan) or Telegram (free plan). See **Initial setup** for details of how to do so.

In addition to covering standard onchain transactions, the Cielo Wallet Tracker supports a wide range of smart contract types. Whenever an account you are monitoring interacts with a compatible smart contract, you will receive an alert.

Smart contracts that can be monitored by the tracker include:

* DEX trades
* Liquidity pools for pairs on any DEX
* Gnosis Safes: treasury wallets for web3 projects
* NFTFi borrowing and lending
* New pools created on Sudoswap
* Derivatives e.g. GMX positions
* Sports betting
* Smart contract approvals/revocations
* ERC20 token swaps
