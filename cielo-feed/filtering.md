# Filtering

Pro members can track up to 600 wallets and smart contracts using the EVM Wallet Tracker bot and Whales up to 1,000 wallets. By default, every tx associated with these wallets will appear in your Cielo Feed. If you’re tracking dozens or even hundreds of wallets, your Feed – like your Telegram bot – can quickly become crowded.

Thankfully, Cielo provides a range of ways to filter and segment the signals you receive. Not only does this prevent information overload, but it makes it easier to discern trends for verticals that you’re interested in such as _NFTs_ or _DeFi_.

The top menu for your Feed looks like this:

In this example, the user is following three wallets. When clicking **Select List…**, two options appear. The first has been auto-created and, if you’re a first-time Cielo user, will be the only option available: **All**. This populates your Cielo feed with all of the wallets that you’re currently following with the EVM Wallet Tracker bot.

In the image above, the user has created a filtered list that contains their personal wallets. Selecting this option from the dropdown menu will populate their Feed solely with tx pertaining to these wallets. Switching back to **All** returns the Feed to its default state.

We’ll explain how to create your own custom List in the next section. But first, there are some preset filters you can apply to make sense of your Feed.

Click on the different icons to filter the tx that the Cielo Feed displays.

**All**: the default setting for your Feed, set to show all tx.

**Highlights**: displays noteworthy tx only, typically recent high value transactions.

**DeFi**: displays DeFi swaps, loans and other trading activity.

**NFTs**: displays NFT mints, trades, and loans.

The final top menu option is **Filter Tx types and Chains**. Clicking on this produces a dropdown menu containing options to filter tx as follows:

* Specific EVM networks (e.g. _Avalanche, Ethereum_)
* Single tx types (_swap, LP, lending, NFT lending, perp, option, NFT trade, NFT mint, NFT transfer, NFT liquidation, SudoPool Creation, Other_)

In the image above, Polygon has been selected. Click on **Clear** to revert the Feed to displaying all transactions.

**Note**: You can mix and match filters to show multiple search parameters e.g. _Avalanche **+** Ethereum **+** NFT lending **+** perps_.

## Summary

Your Cielo feed is a powerful tool for viewing onchain transactions and making sense of them at a glance. These could be your own trades, those of influencers you’re following, or of an entire sector you’re trying to monitor e.g. onchain perps.

Using the basic filters that appear at the top of your Feed, you can quickly burrow deeper into areas of interest, be it a particular blockchain, transaction type, wallet, or theme. The greatest Cielo features, however, which make it the most granular and versatile dashboard of its kind, can be found under [**Customize**](../customize.md). Here, with a few smart selections, you can control multiple feeds to suit your mood, interests, and needs.
