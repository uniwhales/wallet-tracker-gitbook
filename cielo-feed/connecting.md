# Connecting

After authenticating to [app.cielo.finance](https://app.cielo.finance/) for the first time, Pro members will see a notification like this:

If you are a Whale member you will see something like this:

In each of the screenshots above, the user has one Cielo Wallet Tracker bot enabled. This is the minimum requirement to start using Cielo. If you have zero bots enabled, no data will appear in your Cielo feed.

If you don't see the Telegram Bots pop-up upon connecting to Cielo, you'll find it at the top of the [customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize) page. Click the _Bots_ button:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a Whale user, you cannot assign wallets to specific bots until you have activated the bots in Telegram. **First** activate the number of bots you wish to use and **then** you can assign addresses to them.
{% endhint %}
