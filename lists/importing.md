# Importing

To show what can be done with Cielo Lists, and to provide some inspiration, we’ve created two pre-made Lists: _NFT Traders_ and _DeFi_. You’ll see them in the right sidebar on the Customize page. More themed Lists will be added in future including curated selections from UniWhales members.

Before running through the procedure for creating your own List, here’s how to import and view Cielo’s pre-built Lists. On the [Customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize) page, click on the **Follow** button beside the name of the List you wish to import. It will then appear as a tab at the top of your Customize feed.

Be aware that all future tx for a List you import will also appear in your bot Telegram channel. If you _don’t_ wish to receive Telegram alerts, on the Customize page click the blue button alongside each address. This will disable it in Telegram while retaining it in your Cielo Feed.

## Dynamic Lists

Dynamic Lists are Lists created by fellow Cielo members that automatically update anytime their owner amends the List. For example, this is a List showing the top DeFi trading wallets according to Debank. Created by one of the Cielo team, its members will be updated automatically any time the List creator makes changes to it.

You’ll know that the List you’re viewing is dynamic where a yellow icon appears in its tab in Customize, like so:

In addition, in Customize, a yellow dot appears alongside each wallet that has been included as part of a Dynamic List:

A Dynamic List can be altered by its creator at any time, which will be reflected in the wallets that appear in your Cielo feed and Telegram bot.
