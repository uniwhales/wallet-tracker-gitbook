# Importing

To show what can be done with Cielo Lists, and to provide some inspiration, we’ve created two pre-made Lists: _NFT Traders_ and _DeFi_. You’ll see them in the right sidebar on the Customize page. More themed Lists will be added in future including curated selections from UniWhales members.

Before running through the procedure for creating your own List, here’s how to import and view Cielo’s pre-built Lists. On the [Customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize) page, click on the **Follow** button beside the name of the List you wish to import. It will then appear as a tab at the top of your Customize feed.

Be aware that all future tx for a List you import will also appear in your bot Telegram channel. If you _don’t_ wish to receive Telegram alerts, on the Customize page click the blue button alongside each address. This will disable it in Telegram while retaining it in your Cielo Feed.
