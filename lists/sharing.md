Cielo makes it easy to share Lists that you and other Cielo members have created. In [Customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize), click on a tab at the top of the page to select a particular List. Beneath the tab corresponding to the List selected you will then see the following:

This is a List called Debank Top Wallets. Click on the share icon beside the List name and a unique URL for this List will be copied to your clipboard. You can use this link to share the List on social media and elsewhere.

On the right hand side, you can see how many people are following this List and optionally click to unfollow the List.
