# Lists

Lists are the most powerful feature that Cielo builds on top of the EVM Wallet Tracker bot. They are how you segment the data that appears in your Feed and drill down into areas of interest. In just a few clicks, you can create a themed List and populate it with relevant addresses and transaction types.

Your Cielo Feed can be likened to a music player, populated with a diverse collection of your favorite songs. Cielo Lists are your playlists for managing all this music ðŸŽ¶
