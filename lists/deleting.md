# Deleting

You can delete specific entries from a List or even delete the entire List. Deleting a particular entry will _not_ remove that address from your Feed.

To delete a List, on the [Customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize) page click on the edit icon for the List in question and select **Delete List**.

You will then see the following prompt:

If you delete one of Cielo’s premade Lists, you can re-import it at any time by selecting the List in the right hand sidebar and selecting **Follow**. If you delete a List you have created yourself, however, there is no option to reinstate it.

After deleting a List, you will notice that all of its wallet addresses remain visible on Customize under the **All** tab. You will also note these addresses remain in your Feed and in the corresponding EVM Wallet Tracker bot channel. That’s because you have only deleted the List itself.

Removing the addresses from your Cielo altogether involves a second step.

Under [Customize](https://app.cielo.finance/customize), select **Bulk Actions** and tick the yellow icon to select all. This will select all of the wallets that you are currently following for all of your lists. Individually deselect any wallets you do not wish to remove by clicking the corresponding yellow tick.

In the above example, all of the wallets have been selected except for the last two.

When you have finished making your selection, click **Unfollow**.

Click **Continue** to confirm. The addresses you have selected will now be removed from your Cielo Feed and Telegram bot.
