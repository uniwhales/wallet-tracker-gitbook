# Wallet Discovery

Your Cielo feed is only as good as the wallets it contains. [Wallet Discovery](https://app.cielo.finance/wallet-discovery) _(Pro+Whale)_ helps you identify valuable wallets and follow them in one click.

Wallets have been filtered into tags based on trader type e.g. _Gem Finder, New Wallet, Human-Operated_ and are ranked by realized PnL. Note that these are broad categorizations since a wallet will typically fall into multiple categories.

The more successful a wallet's trading activity for the timeframe covered (1, 7, or 30 days), the higher it will rank. Wallet Discovery also reveals when a wallet was last active. Use the right sidebar menu to filter results by wallet type, network, and tags. Click the USD button at the top of the page to toggle between displaying wallet balances in crypto or USD.

**Note**: The wallets featured in Wallet Discovery are updated every 10 minutes on average based on the trading performance of the wallets Cielo has indexed. As a result, this leaderboard can be expected to change frequently.
