# Getting started

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** getting started with the EVM Wallet Tracker is quick, easy and it doesn't cost a thing.
{% endhint %}

There are two ways of setting up the EVM Wallet Tracker: by using the **web app** or via **Telegram**. Your choice will depend on the plan you're using.

The **basic** plan allows you to track up to 10 wallet addresses (across as many chains as the bot supports). It can only be enabled and edited via Telegram.

There are two tiers of paid plan: **Pro** and **Whale**. These require you to hold 5,000 and 16,000 UWL tokens respectively in your wallet. If you're on the paid plan, setup must be enabled via the web app, although subsequent edits can be made in either the web app or Telegram.

Depending on the plan you are using, choose from one of the options below to get started.
