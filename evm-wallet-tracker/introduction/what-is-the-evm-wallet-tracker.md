The EVM Wallet Tracker is the most powerful on-chain tx bot of its kind. It provides unrivaled network coverage and transaction filtering.

## How it works

Every time a transaction is sent over a blockchain network, this information is relayed by nodes. Their job is to alert other network users to recent transactions that alter the state of the network e.g. account balances or smart contract interactions.

ðŸ§  The EVM Wallet Tracker is a customizable bot that detects new transactions and relays tx of interest to Telegram users. By configuring the EVM Wallet Tracker via [Telegram](https://t.me/UniWhales\_wallet\_tracker\_bot) (for the free/paid plan) or [web app](https://app.uniwhales.io/wallet-alerts) (for the paid plan) you can monitor addresses and transaction types that are relevant to your interests while filtering out everything else.

For example, [hereâ€™s](https://t.me/CelsiusEVMTracker) one we created called _Onchain Intrigue_. It's used for monitoring onchain activity associated with Ethereum whales, hackers, VCs, and other market-moving entities. And [hereâ€™s](https://t.me/NFTideasEVMTracker) another for monitoring noteworthy NFT trades and mints. Using the information contained within this guide, you can create and manage your own EVM trackers and use them to access a wealth of rich onchain information.
