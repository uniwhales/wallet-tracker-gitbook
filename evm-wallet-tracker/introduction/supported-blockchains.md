# Supported blockchains

The EVM Wallet Tracker currently supports the following EVM blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Dogechain, Boba, Metis, Aurora, Optimism, BNB, and Evmos.

Please note that the tracker is only compatible with the EVM implementation of these networks. For instance, the tracker can follow tx that occur on Avalanche C-Chain but not on X-Chain or P-Chain.
