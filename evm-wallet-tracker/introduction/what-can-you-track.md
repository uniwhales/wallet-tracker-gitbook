# What can you track?

The EVM Wallet Tracker allows you to follow the on-chain activity of multiple users, addresses, and wallets across 13 EVM networks.

ðŸ‘‰ You can use the EVM Wallet Tracker to watch:

* Your own wallets
* Top DeFi traders
* Whales e.g. [Cai Wensheng](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4093fbe60ab50ab79a5bd32fa2adec255372f80e)
* NFT traders such as those featured in the _NFT Ideas_ EVM Tracker [channel](https://t.me/NFTideasEVMTracker)
* ENS of people you follow on Twitter e.g. [Fallon.eth](https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon)
* Token swaps e.g. _LINK swaps over $10,000 ðŸ”‘ \[currently supported on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism. Minimum tx size: $1,000]_

Itâ€™s up to you to select, segment, and sort the wallets and transaction types you wish to follow so as to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. This will allow you to zero in on the transaction types and users that are of interest to you and to screen the rest.
