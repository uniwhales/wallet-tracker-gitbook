**Good to know:** you can add the tracker to any Telegram group you‚Äôre a member of (provided you have admin rights).
{% endhint %}

üí° Did you know that you can add the EVM Wallet Tracker to an existing Telegram group? There are many reasons why this might be desirable including:

* **NFTs:** If you‚Äôre flipping JPEGs with friends, add the bot to your group for notifications on major sales, floors, and influencer mints
* **DeFi Communities:** Keep track of investor unlocks, foundation funds, treasury transactions and high value swaps for projects you‚Äôre involved with
* **Bull/Bear Signals:** Monitor major buy, sell, volume, and liquidity activity onchain for top tokens to gauge the mood of the markets
* **Degen Trading:** Unsure if a newly created token is the next SHIB or shitcoin? Add the contract address to your EVM Tracker Bot and monitor where it goes from there
* **Ecosystem Tracking:** Enter the addresses of major endpoints in one of the dozen networks the bot monitors and follow the money as it moves through bridges, DEXs, and lending protocols

1. In Telegram click on the [EVM Wallet Tracker](https://t.me/EVMTrackerBot)

### Adding different trackers to different Telegram groups

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** if you would like to add different trackers to different Telegram groups, you will need to upgrade to Pro membership. This allows you to create and manage up to three tracker bots.
{% endhint %}

‚úÖ The Basic version of the EVM Wallet Tracker allows you to create one profile, but you are able to add this tracker to as many Telegram groups as you like.

üîë Pro/Whale tier allows up to three different EVM Wallet Tracker bots to be created, each with its own Telegram channel. Each of these bots can then be added to one or more Telegram groups if desired.

You might create one tracker for monitoring personal transactions; another for NFTs to add to an NFT trading group; and another for liquidations to add to an onchain signals group. Here‚Äôs how to go about doing so.

1. Connect to [https://app.uniwhales.io/wallet-alerts](https://app.uniwhales.io/wallet-alerts)
2. To add a second tracker bot, click on the **Bot#2** button at the top of the page and then follow the instructions in the Telegram channel that opens (_"EVM 2 Premium Wallet Tracker"_)
3. To add a third tracker, do the same with the **Bot#3** button which will open a Telegram channel titled _"EVM 3 Premium Wallet Tracker"_

You can edit your settings for bots 2 and 3 in the usual manner via the web app or directly within the corresponding Telegram channel. Bots 2 and 3 can be added to any Telegram channel you control in the same manner as bot 1 üëè
