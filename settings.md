# Settings

[**Settings**](https://app.cielo.finance/settings) is where you can amend your Cielo plan, adjust bots, and make other account changes.

\
**Plan**: By default, Cielo users start off on the free plan. To upgrade to Pro or Whale, select Upgrade and follow the instructions. More information on Cielo plans can be found [here](https://app.cielo.finance/settings/plans).

**Alerts**: Add/edit your Telegram account and enable/disable bots by toggling the switch. Free users have one bot while Pro have two and Whale users have nine.

**Charting Tool**: Choose whether Cielo's default charting toool is GeckoTerminal, DEX Screener, DEX Tools, or Defined.

**Display Token Address**: Enable this option to display the token contract in Telegram/Discord alerts for Swaps and Approvals. Some users prefer this as it allows them to quickly copy the contract address and paste it into their favorite trading terminal.
