# Overview

Cielo is an information layer for web3. It allows you to discover wallets and tokens and add them to a real-time feed of onchain activity. Transactions can be filtered by type, size, and network and viewed in the Cielo web app or in Discord/Telegram using a Cielo bot. Tokens can also be traded directly within Telegram using the integrated Banana Gun bot.

From tracking whales to monitoring personal wallets, Cielo deciphers the onchain transactions that matter. Zero in on a smart wallet or zoom out to discern broader trends üîé

Monitoring your own wallets allows notification of such events as:

* Being paid by a client
* Receiving an airdrop
* Selling an NFT

Monitoring third party wallets including smart contract addresses reveals such events as:

* Swaps of a particular token e.g. ARB
* Token unlocks and distribution
* NFT mints
* Whale trades
* New tokens traded by wallets you're following

Cielo lets you track up to **250 wallets** for free and up to 10,000 when you upgrade your plan. The wallets Cielo prepopulates your feed with count towards your maximum quota, but you are free to delete or amend these. More information on Cielo plans and features can be found in [Settings](https://app.cielo.finance/settings).\

Cielo provides an insight into **who‚Äôs** trading, **how**, **where**, and **why**.\


**Who**: Add wallet addresses and ENS for top traders, influencers, team treasuries, whales, hedge funds, hackers, and heroes.

**How**: Tx are labeled with useful information such as swap size, protocol, PnL, and direction (long/short perps).

**Where**: Watch the action unfold across all the leading EVM chains, Solana, Bitcoin, and hundreds of protocols, all accurately labeled for ease of identification.

**Why**: Cielo makes it easy to decode the meaning behind the trades that move markets and kickstart trends.
