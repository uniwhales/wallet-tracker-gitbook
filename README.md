# Overview

Cielo is a human-readable information layer for web3. It allows anyone to create a real-time feed of onchain activity and filter it by transaction type, chain, and size.

With millions of transactions recorded onchain every day, making sense of all this activity is beyond the remit of a simple block explorer. Smarter tooling is required to discern what‚Äôs taking place on crypto networks and to leverage this information to your advantage. Cielo is a tool for deciphering the onchain transactions that matter.

From tracking hedge funds to monitoring your own wallets, Cielo demystifies the art of onchain sleuthing. In just a few clicks, you can zero in on the activities of a single trader or zoom out and see the bigger picture to discern DeFi trends üîé

Cielo provides an insight into who‚Äôs trading, how, where, and why.\


**Who**: Add wallet addresses and ENS for top traders, influencers, team treasuries, whales, hedge funds, hackers, and heroes.

**How**: Tx are labeled with swap size, bet size (sportsbooks), PnL (futures + NFT flips), and direction: long or short.

**Where**: Watch the action unfold across all the leading EVM chains and hundreds of protocols, all accurately named for ease of identification.

**Why**: Cielo makes it easy to decode the meaning behind the whale trades and influencer buys that move markets and kickstart trends

The most powerful implementation of Cielo can be found in the [web app](https://app.cielo.finance) that includes an interface for creating themed lists, bulk importing wallet addresses, and a sophisticated NFT dashboard for viewing collections and tracking the best traders.

The Cielo web app is enhanced by a complementary [Telegram bot](https://t.me/EVMTrackerbot) for receiving real-time alerts on the go. The two products can be used independently or combined for the full Cielo experience: the granular control of the web app coupled with the instant notifications supplied by the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot.\


Included with the Cielo web app:

* Real-time feed for transactions on dozens of EVM chains
* Sophisticated protocol labeling and tx types
* Track up to 250 wallets (that‚Äôs 10x more than comparable platforms)
* Create 5 themed lists (e.g. NFT Traders; Onchain Whales; DAOs)
* Track 5 tokens in the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot (e.g. ARB swaps)
* Higher wallet + token tracking thresholds for Pro + Whale users
* Integrated NFT dashboard
* Controls for setting the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot to receive Telegram alerts (up to 6 bots for Pro + Whale)

{% hint style="info" %}

Because Cielo content is user-curated, it‚Äôs dependent upon you to input useful addresses and correctly set their parameters. Otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed with junk data or conversely missing out on significant events because you‚Äôre following irrelevant onchain interactions. The Cielo web app makes it easy to dial down the noise and amplify the signal.

This documentation explains how Cielo works and reveals how to harness its capabilities to get the most out of your onchain exploration üß†

Along the way you‚Äôll learn how to:

* Interpret your feed
* Create custom lists
* Import, modify, and share premade lists
* Filter out low-value transactions

‚Ä¶and much more üëè
