# Telegram Groups + Channels

You can add the Cielo Wallet Tracker to any Telegram group you’re a member of (provided you have admin rights).

There are many reasons why this might be desirable:

* **NFTs**: If you’re flipping JPEGs with frens, add the bot to your group for notifications on major sales, floors, and influencer mints
* **DeFi communities**: Keep track of investor unlocks, foundation funds, treasury transactions and high value swaps for projects you’re involved with
* **Bull/bear signals**: Monitor major buy, sell, volume, and liquidity changes for tokens to gauge the mood of the markets
* **Memecoin trading**: Unsure if a newly created token is the next SHIB or shitcoin? Add the contract address to your bot and monitor where it goes from there
* **Ecosystem tracking**: Enter the addresses of major endpoints in one of the networks Cielo tracks and follow the money as it moves through bridges, DEXs, and lending protocols

### Adding to a group

To add the bot to a group you're a member of, click the blue menu icon in the [Cielo Wallet Tracker](https://t.me/EVMTrackerbot) channel and select _/menu_.

To disable bot alerts within the group, just click **Group Alerts** followed by **Disable group messages**.



### Adding to a channel

If you run a crypto Telegram channel, you can add the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot to it. This will provide followers with alerts that are trelevant to the project or to tokens/verticals that your channel covers.

For instance, if you run a popular Telegram channel, you can program a Cielo bot to only push alerts when your onchain activity corresponds to the interests of your followers such as new token swaps. Alternatively, you could set up a whale trade channel that pushes an alert anyone someone swaps more than $500,000 of ETH onchain.

To add the bot to a channel, click the blue menu icon and select _/main_. Then click **Group Alerts** followed by **Add to channel** and follow the instructions that appear:

### Adding private bot to a group or channel

Pro and Whale users can create private bots for more consistent alert delivery as detailed [here](telegram-private-bot.md). After creating a private bot, you can add it to a group or channel by following the steps outlined above.
