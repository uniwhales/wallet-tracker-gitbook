# Telegram Groups + Channels

You can add the Cielo Wallet Tracker to any Telegram group you’re a member of (provided you have admin rights).

There are many reasons why this might be desirable:

* **NFTs**: If you’re flipping JPEGs with frens, add the bot to your group for notifications on major sales, floors, and influencer mints
* **DeFi communities**: Keep track of investor unlocks, foundation funds, treasury transactions and high value swaps for projects you’re involved with
* **Bull/bear signals**: Monitor major buy, sell, volume, and liquidity changes for tokens to gauge the mood of the markets
* **Memecoin trading**: Unsure if a newly created token is the next SHIB or shitcoin? Add the contract address to your bot and monitor where it goes from there
* **Ecosystem tracking**: Enter the addresses of major endpoints in one of the networks Cielo tracks and follow the money as it moves through bridges, DEXs, and lending protocols

### Adding to a group

To add the bot to a group you're a member of, click the blue menu icon in the [Cielo Wallet Tracker](https://t.me/EVMTrackerbot) channel and select _/menu_.

To disable bot alerts within the group, just click **Group Alerts** followed by **Disable group messages**.



### Adding to a channel

If you run a crypto Telegram channel, you can add the Cielo Wallet Tracker bot to it. This will provide followers with alerts that are trelevant to the project or to tokens/verticals that your channel covers.

For instance, if you run a popular Telegram channel, you can program a Cielo bot to only push alerts when your onchain activity corresponds to the interests of your followers such as new token swaps. Alternatively, you could set up a whale trade channel that pushes an alert anyone someone swaps more than $500,000 of ETH onchain.

To add the bot to a channel, click the blue menu icon and select _/main_. Then click **Group Alerts** followed by **Add to channel** and follow the instructions that appear:

To disable bot alerts within the channel, just click **Channel Alerts** followed by **Disable channel messages**.

### Adding private bot to a group or channel

Pro and Whale users can create private bots for more consistent alert delivery as detailed [here](telegram-private-bot.md). After creating a private bot, you can add it to a group or channel by inviting it as an admin.

After inviting the bot, type _/setup\_bot_ in the group or channel and you should receive a message informing you that the bot is now active. To remove the bot, delete it as a member of the group or channel. See [here](https://x.com/CieloFinance/status/1933554945938104631) for a full video guide on creating a private bot and adding it to a group.

To stop receiving alerts to a private bot, in the Cielo web app go to [**My Wallets**](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets) and from the Bot menu, select the private bot in question. You can then select all wallets and make bulk edits to alerts.

### Adding private bot to a group topic

Telegram lets you organize groups into sub-categories known as topics. To add a private bot to a specific topic in a group:

1. Go to the topic and type _/setup\_bot_.
2. If you've added multiple bots to the group and want each bot to send alerts to a specific topic, you need to specify the bot's username in the command. For example, if the bot's username is _Cielo\_finance\_free\_bot_, use the command: _/setup\_bot@Cielo\_finance\_free\_bot._
