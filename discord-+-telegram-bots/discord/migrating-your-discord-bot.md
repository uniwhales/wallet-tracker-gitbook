# Migrating Your Discord Bot

Cielo has recently upgraded Discord bots to improve user experience. The new system uses webhooks to support greater throughput and provides more consistent alert delivery. If you are an existing Cielo user, you will need to upgrade to the new Discord bot to benefit from this capability.

To migrate to the new Discord bot, open your Discord bot channel and enter the command _/migrate_

Follow the prompts and click the link that appears asking you to approve the updated bot permissions. Once you’ve approved the permissions, return to Discord and enter the command _/create\_webhook_&#x20;

And that’s it: you should have not upgraded to the latest Cielo Discord bot and can start enjoying better performance and enhanced features.
