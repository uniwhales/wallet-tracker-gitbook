# Public Lists

Public lists are themed wallet lists that have been created by Cielo users. Anyone can view and follow a public list. You can also create and share your own public lists.\

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: The wallets contained within a public list count towards the total number of Cielo wallets you can follow. If following a particular list will send you over your maximum wallet threshold, you will receive an alert.
{% endhint %}

## Browsing public lists

The public list explorer automatically filters results by popularity. Hit the **Trending** tab at the top of the leaderboard to filter by date added. Thereâ€™s also a search bar: type in _NFT_ for instance and related public lists will appear.\


The list explorer displays the following information alongside each entry:

**Public List Name**: Applied by the list creator. The creator may optionally include their Twitter handle.

**Description**: Short summary applied by the list creator.

**Wallets**: Number of wallets the list contains.

**Followers**: Number of Cielo users following the list.

**Last Update**: Time since the creator last edited the list.

## Adding a public list

Any Cielo user can create a list and set it to public. Doing so will make it visible to other users via the Explore Wallets page and generate a unique URL that can be shared. Learn more about creating lists [here](my-wallets/lists.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Setting a list as public does not reveal any information about its creator. Your wallet address will not be visible and there will be no personal details shown unless you chose to add your Twitter.
{% endhint %}

Public lists are a great way to glean how other people are using Cielo and to gather ideas of your own. They also provide a quick way to fill your feed with interesting tx and monitor the types of trades that are taking place onchain every day.\
