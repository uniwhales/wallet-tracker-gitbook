# Copy Trading

_This is a detailed guide to copy trading using Cielo as your primary tool for discovering, following, and copying wallets. Navigate this multi-part guide using the side menu or follow the links at the bottom of each section._

Copy trading has evolved into a powerful crypto trading strategy that allows individuals to mirror the trades of experienced investors. This approach enables traders to benefit from the expertise of others, potentially leading to profitable outcomes without the need for extensive market knowledge.​

Instead of spending countless hours analyzing charts, monitoring markets 24/7, or constantly reacting to price swings, copy trading means you can let the pros do the heavy lifting. With Cielo, this approach gets supercharged.

Whether you're new to crypto or just tired of trading emotionally, Cielo helps you trade smarter, not harder.

### How Copy Trading Works

Copy trading is all about replicating the moves of successful traders. Rather than come up with your own strategy, you can let someone else do the work and just copy-paste their success (automatically or manually).

2. **Follow Their Trades**\
   Once you've identified a wallet, you can enable alerts via Telegram or Discord. Anytime they make a move, you’ll be notified instantly.\

3. **Copy the Trade**\
   You can then manually copy their trade using your own wallet, or (if using a bot or automation tool connected to Cielo) replicate it automatically.\

4. **Track Performance**\
   Cielo gives you insights into a wallet’s historical trades, win rate, and profit trends. This lets you evaluate if their strategy fits your risk level.
