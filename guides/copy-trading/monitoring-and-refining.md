# Monitoring and Refining

Copy trading isn’t a set and forget strategy. To maximize your results and minimize risks, it’s essential to regularly monitor your performance and make adjustments as needed. Here’s how you can track, review, and optimize your copy trading activities:

### 1. Execution Logs

As you start copy trading, make a habit of checking your execution logs-think of them as your trading bot’s diary. These logs show every trade made for you, including when and how it happened, the amounts, prices, and the platform used. They also reveal if a trade succeeded or failed, and why. (like not having enough funds or sudden market changes). Plus, you’ll see the transaction fees, which can add up over time. By reviewing your execution logs, you’ll understand your real results, spot issues quickly, and make smarter trading decisions.

### 2. Copy Trade Success Rates

Think of yourself as a coach reviewing your team’s performance after each game. You keep score by tracking your win/loss ratio, seeing how many of your trades ended in profit versus loss. But you don’t stop there, you also compare your moves to the star player you’re copying. Are your results matching theirs, or is there a gap in accuracy? Sometimes, you notice a trade you should have made never happened at all. Maybe your bot missed it due to network congestion or a wallet hiccup. By watching these details, you learn not just how often you win, but how closely you’re following the lead and how to improve your game next time.

### 3. ROI and Performance Metrics

When you’re copy trading, it’s important to regularly check how your investments are performing. Start by looking at your total ROI to see how much you’ve gained or lost overall. Break it down further by reviewing the ROI for each trade or over specific periods, this helps you spot which trades or strategies are working best. Finally, compare your results to those of the lead trader you’re copying by simply opening both token PnL pages in Cielo from you and your target.&#x20;

### 4. Wallet and Portfolio Health

To keep your copy trading on track, it’s important to watch how your wallet and portfolio are changing. Pay attention to your SOL and token balances before and after you start copy trading, so you can clearly see your gains or losses. By regularly reviewing how much of your portfolio is tied up in different assets or strategies, you’ll be able to spot any imbalances and make smarter decisions about where to adjust your approach.

### 5. Risk Metrics

Keeping an eye on risk is just as important as tracking profits. Watch for drawdowns, which show you the biggest drops your portfolio has experienced from its highest point. Pay attention to volatility, or how much your portfolio’s value moves up and down, so you’re not caught off guard by sudden swings. Finally, make sure you’re not putting too much of your funds into a single wallet, token, or strategy. By monitoring these risk metrics, you can better protect your investments and make more balanced decisions as you copy trade.

### 6. Lead Trader Activity

It’s important to keep an eye on the activity of the lead trader you’re copying. Notice how often they make trades. Some traders are very active, while others trade less frequently. Pay attention to any changes in their strategy or the types of assets they focus on; a sudden shift might affect your results. Also, check if their performance remains steady or starts to become unpredictable. By staying aware of your lead trader’s habits and consistency, you’ll be better prepared to react and make adjustments if their performance is no longer fit.

### 7. Market Conditions

Keep an eye on overall market trends to understand if your copy trading results are following the broader market. Also, check if your portfolio is too closely linked to just one coin or sector, as this can increase your risk.

### How to Adjust

* **Reallocate Funds**: Move your capital between different wallets or strategies based on performance.
* **Change Lead Traders**: If a wallet’s performance drops or their strategy changes, consider switching to another leader.
* **Adjust Copy Settings**: Change trade size, risk parameters, or frequency based on your observations.
* **Pause or Stop Copy Trading**: If market conditions are unfavorable or you’re not satisfied with results, don’t hesitate to pause or stop trading.

### Tools and Features to Use

* **Cielo Dashboard**: Use built-in analytics and reporting tools to track all the metrics above.
* **Export Data**: Download your trade history for deeper analysis in Excel or Google Sheets.
* **Notifications**: Set up alerts for large losses, missed trades, or major market move

### Additional Tips

* **Schedule Regular Reviews**: Set a calendar reminder to review your performance weekly or monthly.
* **Document Your Changes**: Keep notes on why you made adjustments. This helps you learn and improve over time.\


By actively monitoring and adjusting your copy trading setup, you’ll be better equipped to optimize your returns, manage risk, and avoid common pitfalls. Remember: successful copy trading is an ongoing process.
