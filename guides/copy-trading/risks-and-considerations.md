# Risks and Considerations

While copy trading can be a powerful tool, especially when paired with Cielo’s insights, it’s not without its risks. Here are a few things to keep in mind before diving in.

#### 1. Don’t Blindly Trust Wallets

Just because a wallet has made smart trades before doesn’t mean they’ll always get it right. Strategies change, market conditions shift, and sometimes even skilled traders make bad calls. Always take time to review a wallet’s historical performance before committing.

#### 2. Crypto Moves Fast

A few seconds can make a big difference. If you're copying trades manually, there’s always a chance you’ll buy in too late and miss the best price, or worse, get caught holding the bag if the trader exits right after you buy in.

#### 3. Context Matters

You’re not just copying trades: you're copying decisions. But without knowing why someone bought a token, or what their exit plan is, you could end up copying half a strategy. That’s a recipe for confusion and potential loss.

#### 4. Automation Isn’t Foolproof

Setting up bots to copy trades can save time, but it also removes human judgment. Without filters or limits, you might:

* Over-commit to a single wallet
* Follow trades that don’t match your risk profile
* Get rugged by a compromised or malicious wallet

#### 5. Fake or Misleading Wallets

Some wallets might look successful on the surface but are actually:

* Involved in pump-and-dump schemes
* Faking volume through wash trading
* Operated by insiders or influencers trying to manipulate markets

Look for consistent ROI, steady activity, and avoid wallets that suddenly spike with unrealistic gains.

#### 6. Fees, Slippage, and Friction

Even on Solana, where fees are low, costs can add up, especially with rapid trades or illiquid tokens. Slippage, trading fees, and timing can all eat into your profits.

Mistakes to avoid when copy trading
-----------------------------------



**1. Allocating too much capital starting out**

When starting with copy trading it’s best to keep your amounts low to see which wallets are profitable and which are not.&#x20;

**2. Failing to monitor your copy positions**

Even when copying others, it’s important to keep track of the trades made. You can’t just buy a token and then forget about it.

**3. Copying wallets that have a very high trade frequency**

Wallets that trade a lot of coins are probably bots and can eat away at your balance. It’s best to find wallets that trade a comparatively low number of tokens but with a good winrate.

**4. Copying wallets that are already copying other wallets**

This will be sub-optimal because you will always have a higher entry price then the wallets before you, especially on high liquidity tokens. The slippage will also be higher because of this. You can however try to find the main source by digging into the token’s trade history using a block explorer.

**5. The risk of copying scam / farmer wallets**

These wallets intentionally create attractive trading patterns to lure copiers before executing exit scams. They may pump tokens, attract investors, then suddenly dump holdings, leaving copiers with heavy losses. Some also trade honeypot tokens that cannot be sold, permanently trapping your funds.&#x20;

**6. Choosing the wrong bot**

Copy trading relies heavily on automation. Selecting the right execution bot is crucial. This isn't just about functionality, it's about finding a tool that:

* Has an intuitive UI you're comfortable with
* Offers customizable settings for fine-tuning
* Balances execution speed with minimal fee costs\


## Considerations when copy trading

&#x20;

**1. Speed Matters, But So Does Precision**

* Delays in execution can cause major slippage or missed entries, especially in volatile markets.
* But going fast without precision leads to unnecessary losses.
* Prioritize speed with stability, especially during high-volume trading windows.\


**2. Fine-Tune Your Settings**

Pay close attention to:

* Slippage Tolerance (buy/sell side). Too tight and you’ll miss trades; too loose and you’ll overpay.
* Trading Fees: These stack up with high-frequency trades, especially in copy strategies where wallets make frequent small trades.
* Gas Settings (when applicable): Ensure optimal fee configs for smooth performance.
* Always double-check your parameters. One misconfigured setting can cascade into repeated bad trades.



**3. Track and Review Performance**

Once the bot is up and running:

* Monitor execution logs
* Check copy trade success rates
* Check ROI of copied wallet to your own

\
Adjust based on market behavior or your lead trader’s activity pattern



**4. Protect Your Capita**l

* Set maximum limits per wallet buying tokens (per hour/day/week)
* Set minimum required market cap to avoid fake tokens/scam wallet activity
