# Finding Good Wallets

Use the following resources to discover good quality wallets to copy trade.

#### 1. Cielo Discovery Page

Avilable to Pro and Whale users, Cielo’s built-in [Discovery page](https://app.cielo.finance/wallet-discovery) (trending) is designed for this exact purpose. Some key strategies here:

* Sort by PnL, ROI, or win rate to find consistently profitable wallets.
* Filter by chain (ETH, BSC, Base, Solana etc.)&#x20;
* Select a tag that you find interesting. (Human Operated, Gem Finder, High Winrate etc.)
* Look for wallets whose last trade was within the last 24 hours.
* Trace a wallet’s full trading history and see how often they win vs. cut losses.



#### 2. Cielo API

The [Cielo API](https://api-info.cielo.finance/) lets you build custom scripts to automate wallet discovery:

* Fetch trending wallets by for example Chain, PnL, Winrate, Hold Time, Last Trade.
* Analyze behavior over time
* Combine with Discord/webhook alerts to get notified when top wallets act.



#### 3. Blockchain Explorers (Etherscan, Basescan, Solscan etc.)

Classic but still very powerful. Some angles here:

* Look for wallets interacting with new tokens or contracts just deployed.
* Use token holders [pages](https://solscan.io/token/KMNo3nJsBXfcpJTVhZcXLW7RmTwTt4GVFE7suUBo9sS#holders) (top 100 holders of a memecoin) and trace their other trades.
* Also useful for confirming if a wallet is trading manually or via a smart contract/bot.
* When found, you can open these wallets in Cielo for review.

####

#### 4. Token Order Books on CEXs

Not directly onchain, but can be a signal source:

* Track tokens that just got listed on major CEXs (e.g., Binance, KuCoin).
* Backtrace wallets that were active just before the CEX listing – they’re likely well-connected.
* Use CEX data + DEX data to see wallets that profit from arbitrage or pre-listing pumps.
* Bonus tip: Check wallets that interact with bridge contracts or liquidity deployments just before listings.

####

#### 5. Smart Money Trackers (Arkham, Nansen, DeBank, Zerion, Chainedge)

These tools already analyze wallets for you. Specific things to do:

* Use Arkham Intelligence to identify funds or whale wallets.
* Use Nansen's “Smart Money” tags to find early buyers, yield farmers, and DEX traders.
* Use DeBank to see full wallet portfolios and yield positions.
* Filter by activity e.g. wallets that do $X in swaps per week.
* Use ChainEDGE to track elite on-chain traders and replicate profitable strategies.
* Alpha Hunter&#x20;
* Dune dashboards

####

#### 6. Telegram/Discord Alpha Groups + Bot Channels

These are goldmines.

* Join groups on Telegram  that share wallet addresses when a call hits. You can find groups for example in the channel of well-known copy trade bots.
* Use bots like DexScreener, DexTools, and CieloBot to track real-time buys/sells.
* Build a system to log addresses mentioned in groups, then analyze trade histories.\


#### 7. Token Sniping Bots

Some wallets are clearly sniping newly deployed contracts.

* Identify first wallets to buy new tokens with low gas (they likely used a bot).
* Backtrace contract deployments and pair creations using DexScreener or TokenSniffer.
* Wallets sniping low-liquidity pairs early are high-risk, high-reward and could be copy trade gems but the potential of losing funds by copying these wallets is significant.

_Only copy sniping bots if you are experienced and understand the risk you’re taking on._



**8. Copy Wallets of Known Influencers**

Some influencers trade publicly from known wallets:

* Find ENS names or promoted trades on their X/Twitter profiles.
* Use DeBank or Cielo to trace their trades.
* Cross-reference with Cielo to see if they're actually profitable.



Using Cielo wallet tags to find quality wallets\



What kind of wallet do you want to track? And for what purpose? Depending on your answer, there are multiple ways to approach this. Whatever your answer, Cielo's wallet tags will help you identify wallets that align with your copy trading goals. Some of these tags help to identify the type of trader behind the wallet. Certain tags can also flag suspicious trading behavior and you should be aware of the risks that come with tracking them.

The following tags can be found on the Cielo profile page for the wallet in question and are also on the Wallet Discovery [page](https://app.cielo.finance/wallet-discovery), where you can search by tag e.g. _Gem Finder._\


**Human-Operated:** Wallet is not controlled by a bot, but by a real human. We carefully check the trading behavior of these wallets in Cielo before adding this tag. There are patterns that indicate that this is not a trading bot.&#x20;

**Gem Finder**: A wallet that made a 2x profit on 30% of all tokens bought. A Gem Finder is known for his exceptional ability to only select a very good performing set of assets. Only if 30% of all tokes trades are with 100% profit will we qualify you as Gem Finder.

\
High Win Rate Wallets

\
Win rate of the target wallet  is higher than 75%.\
\


We decided to give this tag to wallets that manage to achieve a Win Rate over 75%. This is very high, and even more so if you manage to maintain the win rate over a longer period of time/amount of trades. At some point the higher the winrate goes, the more cautious you should be. In case of a 90%+ win rate over a serious amount of trades it becomes too good to be  true.&#x20;

\
New Wallet Wallets

\


First transaction of the wallet was 14 days ago or less.

\


New Wallet tag shows that the first transaction was made only 2 weeks ago. It can be a new identity or it can be an old one that wants a clean sheet. New wallets can be made easily and disguise any previous trading decisions. New wallets are less likely to be tracked by many people, so this can be an advantage.

\


Airdrop Hunter Wallets

\
Target wallet has received at least 5 different airdrops.\
\
Airdrops are rewards to those who have shown conviction to early projects. For Example they invested money, or participated in any event related to the project. It can also be used as a way of promoting. Be cautious when you receive an unknown amount of tokens out of nowhere and do not engage any interaction with those smart contracts!&#x20;

\


Multichain Wallets

\


In Cielo, we use the tag Multichain to identify wallets that have made transactions on at least 5 chains.\
\


As narratives shift quickly, and new blockchains arise easily there are multiple ways to make profits. You can use the tab Related Wallets to find out who and where the target wallet is sending or receiving funds from.\
\


High Leverage Trader Wallets

\
This wallet has 5 or more perpetual transactions where the leverage is 5x or greater.\
\
For those who have a bigger appetite for risk, or simply don’t have the capital to bet with which they would want to, there is the option to lend money to buy positions. We call it perpetual trading, It can be on CEX or DEX and it can lead to quick profits but also big losses. Proceed with caution on leverage trading! This identity has engaged in over 5 positions where the leverage was 5x or greater.

\


NFT High PNL Wallets

\
The wallet has more than 30 ETH realized profits on NFT trading.

\


Non Fungible Token trading can be a lucrative business, any wallet with the tag NFT High PNL has achieved more than 30 Ethereum worth of realized profits on trading NFT’s. Higher fees apply to using platforms like OpenSea.

\


New Whale Wallets

\
New wallet based on wallet age (or low transaction count) that buys over $80k worth an altcoin.

\


Whale is typically used for big identities that are willing to put a significant amount of money on the line. New Whale wallets are fresh wallets that bought one altcoin (low market cap coin) for over 80000 dollars.&#x20;

\


High Volume Dex Trader Wallets

\
Total Decentralized Exchange trading value is over $10m.&#x20;

\


This wallet has been trading significant volume on a DEX, in trade amount or trade size. Take a good look at the numbers under Bought/Sold to identify if this size of a player is worth tracking for you.

\


Popular Wallets

\
Over 30 Cielo users are tracking this wallet. Target wallet has been found by multiple users of our platform and have added it in their list for tracking.&#x20;

\


Flipper Wallets

\


Indicates that the wallet trades a high number of tokens and sells them promptly to realize quick profits.

\


A wallet with the Flipper tag will be trading on a high frequency but not necessarily with huge amounts like the High Volume Dex Trader. However you will see a high amount of tokens traded on the daily timeframe, where others don’t even reach the same amounts in a week or month. In this case, be wary of the amount of trades per token because if this number is high too, things multiply exponentially and it can lead to high fees.

\


MEV Wallets

\
Maximal Extractable Value wallets, they can maximize profits by optimizing transaction order, timing and execution.&#x20;

\


For example they can do Sandwich Attacks, Liquidation Sniping and exploiting arbitrage (trade price difference over multiple exchanges).

\
Sniper Wallets

\
Average token hold time is less than 2 minutes.\
\
For example, you found a wallet with great PnL and ROI stats. If all tokens traded hold time is less than 2 minutes its likely achieved by sniper behaviour. Target wallet is always first to buy specific tokens, and sells them within 2 minutes. The wallet probably has inside information and uses bots to buy and select which launches are good to snipe. He aims for quick profits. Time is of the essence in this case, and it's unlikely you will achieve similar results buying the same token manually.

\


Alpha Wallets

\


These are the wallets that consistently spot promising projects before they hit the mainstream. Their owners ride the first wave of hype, often capturing 10x gains before the rest of the market catches on. Alpha wallets are icons in copy trading circles-their moves are studied, and their reputations are built on early wins and keen instincts.

\


Bundled Wallets

\


These wallets scatter large token holdings across multiple addresses, making projects appear more decentralized and secure than they are. The result? Massive, misleading early price spikes. Spotting their footprint requires a keen eye-look for unusually large initial candles on token launch charts.

\
