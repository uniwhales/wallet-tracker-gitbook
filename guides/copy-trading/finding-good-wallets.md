# Finding Good Wallets

Use the following resources to discover good quality wallets to copy trade.

#### 1. Cielo Discovery Page

Avilable to Pro and Whale users, Cielo’s built-in [Discovery page](https://app.cielo.finance/wallet-discovery) (trending) is designed for this exact purpose. Some key strategies here:

* Sort by PnL, ROI, or win rate to find consistently profitable wallets.
* Filter by chain (ETH, BSC, Base, Solana etc.)&#x20;
* Select a tag that you find interesting. (Human Operated, Gem Finder, High Winrate etc.)
* Look for wallets whose last trade was within the last 24 hours.
* Trace a wallet’s full trading history and see how often they win vs. cut losses.



#### 2. Cielo API

The [Cielo API](https://api-info.cielo.finance/) lets you build custom scripts to automate wallet discovery:

* Fetch trending wallets by for example Chain, PnL, Winrate, Hold Time, Last Trade.
* Analyze behavior over time
* Combine with Discord/webhook alerts to get notified when top wallets act.



#### 3. Blockchain Explorers (Etherscan, Basescan, Solscan etc.)

Classic but still very powerful. Some angles here:

* Look for wallets interacting with new tokens or contracts just deployed.
* Use token holders [pages](https://solscan.io/token/KMNo3nJsBXfcpJTVhZcXLW7RmTwTt4GVFE7suUBo9sS#holders) (top 100 holders of a memecoin) and trace their other trades.
* Also useful for confirming if a wallet is trading manually or via a smart contract/bot.
* When found, you can open these wallets in Cielo for review.

####

#### 4. Token Order Books on CEXs

Not directly onchain, but can be a signal source:

* Track tokens that just got listed on major CEXs (e.g., Binance, KuCoin).
* Backtrace wallets that were active just before the CEX listing – they’re likely well-connected.
* Use CEX data + DEX data to see wallets that profit from arbitrage or pre-listing pumps.
* Bonus tip: Check wallets that interact with bridge contracts or liquidity deployments just before listings.

####

#### 5. Smart Money Trackers (Arkham, Nansen, DeBank, Zerion, Chainedge)

These tools already analyze wallets for you. Specific things to do:

* Use Arkham Intelligence to identify funds or whale wallets.
* Use Nansen's “Smart Money” tags to find early buyers, yield farmers, and DEX traders.
* Use DeBank to see full wallet portfolios and yield positions.
* Filter by activity e.g. wallets that do $X in swaps per week.
* Use ChainEDGE to track elite on-chain traders and replicate profitable strategies.
* Alpha Hunter&#x20;
* Dune dashboards

####

#### 6. Telegram/Discord Alpha Groups + Bot Channels

These are goldmines.

* Join groups on Telegram  that share wallet addresses when a call hits. You can find groups for example in the channel of well-known copy trade bots.
* Use bots like DexScreener, DexTools, and CieloBot to track real-time buys/sells.
* Build a system to log addresses mentioned in groups, then analyze trade histories.\


#### 7. Token Sniping Bots

Some wallets are clearly sniping newly deployed contracts.

* Identify first wallets to buy new tokens with low gas (they likely used a bot).
* Backtrace contract deployments and pair creations using DexScreener or TokenSniffer.
* Wallets sniping low-liquidity pairs early are high-risk, high-reward and could be copy trade gems but the potential of losing funds by copying these wallets is significant.

_Only copy sniping bots if you are experienced and understand the risk you’re taking on._



**8. Copy Wallets of Known Influencers**

Some influencers trade publicly from known wallets:

* Find ENS names or promoted trades on their X/Twitter profiles.
* Use DeBank or Cielo to trace their trades.
* Cross-reference with Cielo to see if they're actually profitable.



Using Cielo wallet tags to find quality wallets\



What kind of wallet do you want to track? And for what purpose? Depending on your answer, there are multiple ways to approach this. Whatever your answer, Cielo's wallet tags will help you identify wallets that align with your copy trading goals. Some of these tags help to identify the type of trader behind the wallet. Certain tags can also flag suspicious trading behavior and you should be aware of the risks that come with tracking them.

The following tags can be found on the Cielo profile page for the wallet in question and are also on the Wallet Discovery [page](https://app.cielo.finance/wallet-discovery), where you can search by tag e.g. _Gem Finder._\


**Human-Operated:** Wallet is not controlled by a bot, but by a real human. We carefully check the trading behavior of these wallets in Cielo before adding this tag. There are patterns that indicate that this is not a trading bot.&#x20;

**Gem Finder**: A wallet that made a 2x profit on 30% of all tokens bought. A Gem Finder is known for his exceptional ability to only select a very good performing set of assets. Only if 30% of all tokes trades are with 100% profit will we qualify you as Gem Finder.

**High Win Rate**: Win rate is higher than 75%. This is a very high win rate, and is particularly hard to maintain over a longer period of time/amount of trades. At some point, the higher the win rate goes, the more cautious you should be. A wallet that shows a 90%+ win rate over a serious amount of trades it likely too good to be  true and should be treated with caution.

**New Wallet**: First transaction made by the wallet was 14 days ago or less. This wallet could be operated by a new identity or it could be an old one that wants a clean sheet. New wallets can be made easily and disguise any previous trading decisions. These wallets are unlikely to be tracked by a huge number of people initially, so following them can be an advantage.

**Airdrop Hunter**: Target wallet has received at least 5 different airdrops. Airdrops are awarded to users who have shown conviction in early projects. For example they invested money, or participated on a testmet and were airdropped tokens when the mainnet launched. Wallets with this tag are likely to be proficient with interacting with new protocols and tokens.

**Multichain**: Wallets that have made transactions on at least 5 chains. Because these wallets are operated by users who are proficient at navigating the cross-chain landscape, following their moves and keeping tabs on the related wallets found in their Cielo profile can be useful in identifying alpha and new opportunities.\
\
**High Leverage Trader**: This wallet has 5 or more perpetual transactions where the leverage was 5x or greater. For those who have a bigger appetite for risk, or wish to amplify the potential returns from their limited capital, perpetual trading can be attractive. Proceed with caution when engaging in leveraged trading, however, as it's easy to be liquidated and lose all your capital.

**NFT High PNL**: This wallet has more than 30 ETH realized profit on NFT trading.

**New Whale:** New wallet based on wallet age (or low transaction count) that buys over $80k worth an altcoin. Such a wallet is operated by a trader willing to put a significant amount of money on the line and with the potential to move markets, especially for low-cap tokens that are less liquid.

**High Volume Dex Trader**: Total DEX trading volume is over $10m. This wallet has been trading significant volume on a DEX, in trade amount or trade size. Take a good look at the numbers under Bought/Sold to identify if the wallet in question is worth tracking for you.

**Popular Wallet:** Over 30 Cielo users are tracking this wallet. Target wallet has been found by multiple users of our platform who have added it in their list for tracking.&#x20;

**Flipper:** Indicates that the wallet trades a high number of tokens and sells them promptly to realize quick profits. A wallet with the Flipper tag will be trading on a high frequency but not necessarily with huge amounts. However you will see a high number of tokens traded on a daily timeframe. If you're thinking of copy trading them, be wary of the amount of trades per token because if this number is also high, things multiply exponentially resulting in high fees.

**MEV:** Maximal Extractable Value wallets can maximize profits by optimizing transaction order, timing, and execution. For example they can perform Sandwich Attacks, Liquidation Sniping, and exploiting Arbitrage (trade price difference over multiple exchanges).

**Sniper**: Average token hold time is less than 2 minutes. You'll often find a wallet with great PnL and ROI stats. If the average hold time for all tokens traded is less than 2 minutes, however, it's likely achieved by sniping. Target wallet is always first to buy specific tokens,and sells them within 2 minutes. The wallet probably has inside information and uses bots to buy and select which launches are good to snipe. Time is of the essence in this case, and it's unlikely you will achieve similar results buying the same token manually.

### Choosing Your Path

Each wallet type offers a unique entry point into the world of crypto copy trading. Whether you’re drawn to the speed of bots, the instincts of early movers, or the steady hand of experienced traders, understanding these wallet archetypes will help you identify the right kind of trader to copy.
