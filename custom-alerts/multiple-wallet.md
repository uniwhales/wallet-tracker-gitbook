# Multiple Wallet

If you’re creating a **Multiple Wallet** alert (MWA), select this option from the dropdown menu and then specify the number of wallets. Choose five wallets, for example, and you will receive an alert when five wallets you’re following trade a particular token for the first time. By default, all networks Cielo supports are enabled for this feature, but if you prefer you can enable Multiple Wallet alerts for one network only. You can also select specific lists to apply Multiple Wallet alerts to and can choose a timeframe too, from 1-24 hours.

* Select **1 hour** and you will _only_ receive an alert if X wallets have purchased that token within the last hour.
* Select **24 hours** and you will receive an alert if X wallets have purchased that token at any time in the last 24 hours.

Multiple Wallet alerts will appear like this:

You will receive an alert when a minimum of **three** wallets have purchased a particular token within a 24-hour period. The more wallets you follow, the greater the frequency of the Multiple Wallet alerts you are likely to receive.

Each alert displays the number of wallets you're following that have purchases the token, their average purchase price, and total volume.&#x20;
