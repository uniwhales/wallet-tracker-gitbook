# My Wallets

[**My Wallets**](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets) is your mission control. It’s where you add, edit, and delete wallets and lists. It’s also where you control the Telegram/Discord alerts you receive for wallets and lists you’re following.

## Adding Wallets

Click **Add Wallets** in the top right to add a wallet to your Cielo feed. You can add an Ethereum address, Solana address, ENS, or .sol.

\
Enter the wallet address and add an optional label for identification e.g. _Vitalik_. If you wish to add and configure Telegram/Discord bot alerts for the wallet, select **Alert Settings** and follow the instructions. Here you can specify notifications based on tx type, chain, and minimum USD value for swaps. You can also check the New Trade Alerts box to receive an alert when the wallet trades a token for the first time.\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** **Alert Settings** only applies filters to your Telegram or Discord bots. It does not filter the tx that appear in your Cielo feed. To change the default view for your feed, use the tabs at the top of the Feed page.\

{% endhint %}

If you wish to add multiple wallets at once, select **Bulk Import** and you can upload a CSV file. Wallet addresses should be placed in column one and an optional label for each one should go in column two.

## Editing Wallets

Tick the checkbox at the top of the page to select all wallets or select individual wallets and make edits to them. You can also use the tabs at the top of the **My Wallets** page to filter wallets by list, type, chain,  and whether they are currently unassigned to a list.

After selecting one or more wallets, click the pencil icon to make edits. When you're done, click **Save Changes**.



## Token Filters

Cielo allows you set alerts when a wallet you're following trades specific tokens or NFTs _(Pro+Whale)._ That way you can receive a notification when wallets swap particular tokens you're interested in and screen the rest of their onchain activity.

To set an alert, in **My Wallets** click the filter icon for a particular wallet or select all wallets if you want to batch add a token alert.

In the popup window that appears, enter the token address and chain for each token alert you wish to add. You can enable up to 10 unique token alerts per wallet.
