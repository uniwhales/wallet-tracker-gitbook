# My Wallets

[**My Wallets**](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets) is your mission control. It’s where you add, edit, and delete wallets and lists. It’s also where you control the Telegram/Discord alerts you receive for wallets and lists you’re following.

## Adding Wallets

Click **Add Wallets** in the top right to add a wallet to your Cielo feed. You can add an Ethereum address, Solana address, ENS, or .sol.

Enter the wallet address and add an optional label for identification e.g. _Vitalik_. If you wish to add and configure Telegram/Discord bot alerts for the wallet, select **Alert Settings** and follow the instructions. Here you can specify notifications based on tx type, chain, and minimum USD value for swaps. You can also check the **New Trade Alerts** box to receive an alert when the wallet trades a token for the first time – see [below](./#new-trade-alerts) for more information on this feature.

### Bulk Import

Click the **Bulk Import** button to upload multiple wallets as a CSV (spreadsheet) file. Place the wallets you wish to import in column one and an optional label for each wallet in column two. Commence upload and your wallets will be uploaded within a couple of minutes on average. You can also assign all imported wallets to a specific list or apply alert filters to them, saving you from having to edit each wallet individually in My Wallets.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** **Alert Settings** only applies filters to your Telegram or Discord bots. It does not filter the tx that appear in your Cielo feed. To change the default view for your feed, use the tabs at the top of the Feed page.\

{% endhint %}

If you wish to add multiple wallets at once, select **Bulk Import** and you can upload a CSV file. Wallet addresses should be placed in column one and an optional label for each one should go in column two.

## Editing Wallets

Tick the checkbox at the top of the page to select all wallets or select individual wallets and make edits to them. You can also use the tabs at the top of the **My Wallets** page to filter wallets by list, type, chain,  and whether they are currently unassigned to a list.

After selecting one or more wallets, click the pencil icon to make edits. When you're done, click **Save Changes**.



## Bulk Edits

You can edit multiple wallets to save time. This allows you to bulk edit Telegram/Discord alerts for all of the wallets you're following or a subset of wallets. For instance, you can enable Telegram alerts for _Swaps over $100_ or for _NFT Mints on Base_. You will still be able to see all of the onchain activity for these wallets in your Cielo feed but will only receive bot alerts for tx that match your criteria.

To make a bulk edit, click the checkbox in the top left of the screen. This will select all wallets on the page. To select all wallets that youi're following, click **Select all XXX of your wallets**:

You can alternatively select all wallets within a specific list. To do so, click the **Lists** tab at the top of the page and select the desired list. Then tick the **All Wallets** box.

When you have selected the wallets you wish to bulk edit, click **Alert Settings** or **Token / NFT Filters** _(Pro+Whale)_ at the bottom of the page.
