# My Wallets

[**My Wallets**](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets) is your mission control. Itâ€™s where you add, edit, and delete wallets and lists. Itâ€™s also where you control the Telegram/Discord alerts you receive for wallets and lists youâ€™re following.

## Adding Wallets

Click **Add Wallets** in the top right to add a wallet to your Cielo feed. You can add an Ethereum address, Solana address, ENS, or .sol.

\
Enter the wallet address and add an optional label for identification e.g. _Vitalik_. If you wish to add and configure Telegram/Discord bot alerts for the wallet, select **Alert Settings** and follow the instructions.\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** **Alert Settings** only applies filters to your Telegram or Discord bots. It does not filter the tx that appear in your Cielo feed. To change the default view for your feed, use the tabs at the top of the Feed page.\

{% endhint %}

If you wish to add multiple wallets at once, select **Bulk Import** and you can upload a CSV file. Wallet addresses should be placed in column one and an optional label for each one should go in column two.

## Editing Wallets

Tick the checkbox at the top of the page to select all wallets or select individual wallets and make edits to them. You can also use the tabs at the top of the **My Wallets** page to filter wallets by list, type, and whether they are currently unassigned to a list.

After selecting one or more wallets, click the pencil icon to make edits. When you're done, click **Save Changes**.

## Lists

Your Cielo feed can be likened to a music player, populated with a diverse collection of sounds. Cielo lists are your playlists for managing all this music ðŸŽ¶

Lists are how you segment transactions from specific wallets and focus on areas of interest. In just a few clicks, you can create a themed list and populate it with related addresses and transaction types. This makes it easier to discern market trends, sentiment, and behaviors.

Cielo free users can create up to 5 lists, while Whale/Pro subscribers can create 10/20. You can also enable Telegram or Discord bots to receive list alerts. You can choose to be notified of all tx made by wallets within a list or a subset of these tx that meet your criteria.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: By default, any list you create in Cielo is private and visible to you only. To share a list, change it to Public. This will allow it to be viewed by anyone.
{% endhint %}

To create a list, visit [My Wallets](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets), tick the checkbox for at least one wallet and select Add to List. Follow the prompts to add the wallet to an existing list youâ€™ve created or to a new list.

To edit a list, select it from the Lists tab and click the edit icon. This allows you to update the list name, add a description, and optionally make the list public. You can also make a public list youâ€™ve created private again, if you desire.

If you are following a public list created by another user, the only edits you can make to it concern bot notifications. For example, you can specify the tx types and wallets within the public list that generate Telegram/Discord alerts.

If a list has been set to public, you can share it by clicking the share icon that appears alongside it:

To permanently delete a list, load the list in **My Wallets** and then click **Delete**.

If you choose to retain the wallets within the list, they will remain in your Cielo feed and will revert to _Unassigned_. You can subsequently add these wallets to a new or existing list if desired.
