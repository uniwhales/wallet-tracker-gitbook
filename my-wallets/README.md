# My Wallets

[**My Wallets**](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets) is your mission control. It’s where you add, edit, and delete wallets and lists. It’s also where you control the Telegram/Discord alerts you receive for wallets and lists you’re following.

## Adding Wallets

Click **Add Wallets** in the top right to add a wallet to your Cielo feed. You can add an Ethereum address, Solana address, ENS, or .sol.

Enter the wallet address and add an optional label for identification e.g. _Vitalik_. If you wish to add and configure Telegram/Discord bot alerts for the wallet, select **Alert Settings** and follow the instructions.\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** **Alert Settings** only applies filters to your Telegram or Discord bots. It does not filter the tx that appear in your Cielo feed. To change the default view for your feed, use the tabs at the top of the Feed page.\

{% endhint %}

If you wish to add multiple wallets at once, select **Bulk Import** and you can upload a CSV file. Wallet addresses should be placed in column one and an optional label for each one should go in column two.

## Editing Wallets

Tick the checkbox at the top of the page to select all wallets or select individual wallets and make edits to them. You can also use the tabs at the top of the My Wallets page to filter wallets based on list, type, and whether they are currently unassigned to a list.
