# Token Filters

Cielo allows you set alerts when a wallet you're following trades specific tokens or NFTs _(Pro+Whale)._ That way you can receive a notification when wallets swap particular tokens you're interested in and screen the rest of their onchain activity.

To set an alert, in **My Wallets** click the filter icon for a particular wallet or select all wallets if you want to batch add a token alert.

In the popup window that appears, enter the token address and chain for each token alert you wish to add. You can enable up to 10 unique token alerts per wallet.
