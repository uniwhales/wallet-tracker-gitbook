# New Trade Alerts

Available to Pro and Whale users, New Trade Alerts enables you to receive an alert whenever a wallet you're following trades a particular token for the first time. To enable this feature, in **My Wallets** click the edit icon alongside a particular wallet and then click the tab marked **Alert Settings**. (Alternatively, select all wallets on a page or within a list and then click the **Alert Settings** button to make bulk edits.)

For the wallet(s) selected, click the **New Trade Alerts** switch to activate this feature. In the **Wallet Info** tab, make sure you have assigned the wallet(s) to a particular bot. You will now receive a bot alert whenever the selected wallet(s) trades a particular token for the first time.

Some users also like to be alerted when a wallet they're tracking **sell**s a new token for the first time. This feature can be enabled for New Trade Alerts. To do so, go to [Advanced Settings](https://app.cielo.finance/settings/advanced) and check the box marked **First Sell Alerts**.
