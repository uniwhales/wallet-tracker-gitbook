# Bulk Edits

You can edit multiple wallets to save time. This allows you to bulk edit Telegram/Discord alerts for all of the wallets you're following or a subset of wallets. For instance, you can enable Telegram alerts for _Swaps over $100_ or for _NFT Mints on Base_. You will still be able to see all of the onchain activity for these wallets in your Cielo feed but will only receive bot alerts for tx that match your criteria.

To make a bulk edit, click the checkbox in the top left of the screen. This will select all wallets on the page. To select all wallets that youi're following, click **Select all XXX of your wallets**:
