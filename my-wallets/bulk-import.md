# Bulk Import

Click the **Bulk Import** button to upload multiple wallets as a CSV (spreadsheet) file. Place the wallets you wish to import in column one and an optional label for each wallet in column two. Commence upload and your wallets will be uploaded within a couple of minutes on average. You can also assign all imported wallets to a specific list or apply alert filters to them, saving you from having to edit each wallet individually in My Wallets.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** **Alert Settings** only applies filters to your Telegram or Discord bots. It does not filter the tx that appear in your Cielo feed. To change the default view for your feed, use the tabs at the top of the Feed page.\

{% endhint %}

If you wish to add multiple wallets at once, select **Bulk Import** and you can upload a CSV file. Wallet addresses should be placed in column one and an optional label for each one should go in column&#x20;
