# Tokens

Cielo supports alerts for token transactions on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Polygon.

Free users can follow up to five tokens and receive Telegram/Discord alerts while Pro users can track 10 tokens and Whale can track 30.

To get started, click the **Add tokens** button on the [tokens page](https://app.cielo.finance/configure/tokens) and enter the smart contract address for the token you wish to follow. (You can find this on a block explorer for the network in question or from a market data aggregator such as CoinGecko.)

After entering the token address, select a chain, a minimum tx amount, and choose a Telegram bot to assign alerts to. Then click the **Add token** button to save your selection.\


To edit settings for a token youâ€™re tracking, just click the gear wheel icon alongside it.



{% hint style="info" %}
Cielo enforces a minimum $1,000 threshold for tokens you're tracking. This is to prevent your feed and bots from being overwhelmed by alerts.
