Cielo is packed with powerful features including advanced tools for professional wallet trackers and traders. You don't need to be familiar with all of these to start benefiting from Cielo though. In fact, you can be up and running in as little as 60 seconds.

* Visit the Cielo [web app](https://app.cielo.finance/) and click the **Connect** button in the top right. The above popup will appear and you can connect your web wallet. (Click the Solana tab to select an EVM wallet if you prefer.)
* Next, click to sign the wallet transaction that pops up. This is used to verify ownership of the wallet you're connecting with and does _not_ authorize Cielo to access any funds.

With these two steps completed, you're now connected to the Cielo web app and able to start your voyage of onchain discovery, from tracking wallets to trading Solana tokens.

If you're interested in Solana trading, the final step before you can get started is to deposit some SOL to the trading wallet that Cielo auto-generates when you first connect to the web app.

* In the top right of the page, click the red wallet icon to view the address of your Solana trading wallet. Click **Deposit** and click again to agree to the terms and conditions. You can now send SOL to your trading wallet and get started.

If you're not looking to start trading at this time, and would rather use Cielo for wallet tracking you can skip this step. Instead, follow the guide below to begin tracking your first wallets and receiving Telegram alerts:



1. Go to [Tracking](https://app.cielo.finance/tracking), click **Add Wallets** (top right), enter a wallet address and add a label. Repeat.
2. Alternatively, go to [Public Lists](https://app.cielo.finance/public-lists), find an interesting list and click **Follow**.&#x20;
3. In **Tracking**, create your own list by clicking **Add List** (top right).
4. From the **Lists** tab at the top of the page, select your list and then tick the wallets you wish to add.
5. To set Telegram/Discord alerts, first go to **Settings >** [**Alerts**](https://app.cielo.finance/settings/alerts) and activate a bot.
6. Then in **Tracking** tick the box to the left of the wallets you wish to set alerts for or click **Select All**.
7. Next, click **Alert Settings** (bottom of page) or click the edit icon to the right of the wallet label.
8. Finally pick the transaction types, USD value, and networks you wish to receive Telegram/Discord alerts for.
9. View recent transactions made by wallets you’re following in [**Feed**](https://app.cielo.finance/feed). Use the options in the right sidebar to filter results.
10. Unlock additional features including the ability to track more wallets in **Settings >** [**Plans**](https://app.cielo.finance/settings/plans).
