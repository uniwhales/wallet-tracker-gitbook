Cielo is packed with powerful features including advanced tools for professional wallet trackers and traders. You don't need to be familiar with all of these to start benefiting from Cielo though. In fact, you can be up and running in as little as 60 seconds.

* Visit the Cielo [web app](https://app.cielo.finance/) and click the **Connect** button in the top right. The above popup will appear and you can connect your web wallet. (Click the Solana tab to select an EVM wallet if you prefer.)
* Next, click to sign the wallet transaction that pops up. This is used to verify ownership of the wallet you're connecting with and does _not_ authorize Cielo to access any funds.

With these two steps completed, you're now connected to the Cielo web app and able to start tracking wallets and trading Solana tokens.



1. Go to [My Wallets](https://app.cielo.finance/my-wallets), click **Add Wallets** (top right), enter a wallet address and add a label. Repeat.
2. Alternatively, go to [Public Lists](https://app.cielo.finance/public-lists), find an interesting list and click **Follow**.&#x20;
3. In **My Wallets**, create your own list by clicking **Add List** (top right).
4. From the **Lists** tab at the top of the page, select your list and then tick the wallets you wish to add.
5. To set Telegram/Discord alerts, first go to [**Settings**](https://app.cielo.finance/settings) and activate a bot.
6. Then in **My Wallets** tick the box to the left of the wallets you wish to set alerts for or click **Select All**.
7. Next, click **Alert Settings** (bottom of page) or click the edit icon to the right of the wallet label.
8. Finally pick the transaction types, USD value, and networks you wish to receive Telegram/Discord alerts for.
9. View all transactions by wallets you’re following in your Cielo [feed](https://app.cielo.finance/feed). Use the tabs at the top of your feed to filter results and click **Save** to store your favorite filters.
10. Unlock additional features and more wallets by visiting [**Settings**](https://app.cielo.finance/settings) and subscribing to a Pro or Whale plan.
11. If you would like to execute trades within Telegram, create a [**Banana Gun bot**](https://t.me/BananaGunRegister_bot). You can then click the **Buy on Banana Gun** link displayed in Cielo alerts to instantly buy the token in question.
