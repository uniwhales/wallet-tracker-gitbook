4. In the Label field add a name for the wallet if desired e.g. _Payroll_
5. In the next field, enter a minimum transaction amount in USD if you wish to filter out low value tx (this option is only available to Pro subscribers)
6. To deselect any of the blockchains monitored by the bot, click on their names e.g. _Avalanche_
