# Disabling blockchains

{% hint style="info" %}
**In brief:** by default, the EVM Wallet Tracker monitors transactions that occur across all of the blockchains it supports (currently 11). You might wish to adjust these settings at a later date to disable chains you’re not using or that are generating spam tx.
{% endhint %}

To amend the blockchains you’re monitoring, click the blue **Edit** button for a particular wallet on the web app dashboard and then click to deselect any of the networks whose names appear in blue. Then hit the **Save** button.

Alternatively, click the **List** button in the EVM Wallet Tracker [Telegram](https://t.me/EVMTrackerBot) channel followed by the blue **edit** hyperlink for the wallet you wish to update. Then click on the **Edit chains** button and update your preferences accordingly.
