# Adding different trackers to different Telegram groups

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** if you would like to add different trackers to different Telegram groups, you will need to upgrade to Pro membership. This allows you to create and manage up to three tracker bots.
{% endhint %}

The free version of the EVM Wallet Tracker allows you to create one profile. However you are able to add this tracker to as many Telegram groups as you like.

You might create one for monitoring personal transactions; another for NFTs to add to an NFT trading group; and another for liquidations to add to an onchain signals group. Here’s how to go about doing so.

1. Connect to [https://app.uniwhales.io/wallet-alerts](https://app.uniwhales.io/wallet-alerts)
2. To add a second tracker bot, click on the **Bot#2** button at the top of the page and then follow the instructions in the Telegram channel that opens (_"EVM 2 Premium Wallet Tracker"_)
3. To add a third tracker, do the same with the **Bot#3** button which will open a Telegram channel titled _"EVM 3 Premium Wallet Tracker"_

You can edit your settings for bots 2 and 3 in the usual manner via the web app or directly within the corresponding Telegram channel. Bots 2 and 3 can be added to any Telegram channel you control in the same manner as bot 1.
