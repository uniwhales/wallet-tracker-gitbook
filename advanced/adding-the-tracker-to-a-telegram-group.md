# Adding the tracker to a Telegram group

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** you can add the tracker to any Telegram group you’re a member of (provided you have admin rights).
{% endhint %}

There are many reasons why it might be desirable to add the EVM Wallet Tracker to an existing Telegram group. These include:

* **NFTs:** If you’re flipping JPEGs with friends, add the bot to your group for notifications on major sales, floors, and influencer mints
* **DeFi Communities:** Keep track of investor unlocks, foundation funds, treasury transactions and high value swaps for projects you’re involved with
* **Bull/Bear Signals:** Monitor major buy, sell, volume, and liquidity activity onchain for top tokens to gauge the mood of the markets
* **Degen Trading:** Unsure if a newly created token is the next SHIB or shitcoin? Add the contract address to your EVM Tracker Bot and monitor where it goes from there
* **Ecosystem Tracking:** Enter the addresses of major endpoints in one of the dozen networks the bot monitors and follow the money as it moves through bridges, DEXs, and lending protocols

### Adding the EVM Wallet Tracker to your Telegram group

1. In Telegram click on the [EVM Wallet Tracker](https://t.me/EVMTrackerBot)
