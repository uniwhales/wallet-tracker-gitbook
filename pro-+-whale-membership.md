# Pro + Whale membership

The Cielo web app and Cielo Wallet Tracker bot are free to use. Up to 250 wallets can be tracked with no subscription, fees, or payment details required. For users who wish to access additional features, including the ability to track more wallets, Pro and Whale tier Cielo membership is available.

**Pro** users can access two Telegram bots and track 1,000 wallets, while **Whale** users can access six Telegram bots and track 10,000 wallets.\


### Pro

To become a Pro or Whale user, you must hold the minimum number of tokens in your web wallet to access that tier. For instance, you require 5,000 UWL to become a Pro user. These tokens should be held in the same wallet you are using with Cielo. UWL can be acquired on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x6a61cd16ec0c73b3855beecc4c378dcbdb63f88e).\


Should you later sell your UWL tokens, your Cielo account will revert to a free account and your permissions will reduce accordingly.
