# Stats

The [Stats](https://app.cielo.finance/stats) section of Cielo gives you an overview of the activity for addresses you're following. It aggregates all of the recent transactions for your Feed based on activity in the last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. Click the tabs in the top right of the Stats page to cycle through timeframes.

Click on the dropdown menu titled **All** to filter results to show a specific List you're following. This could be a List you've created yourself or a pre-made List by another Cielo user you've imported.
