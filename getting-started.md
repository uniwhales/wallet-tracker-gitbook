**My Feed** displays recent transactions by wallets Cielo has preselected for you. You can edit these wallets and add new ones once you're logged in.

To start using Cielo, you need to log in by connecting your web wallet. To do so, click the **Connect** button in the top right of the page.

Your web wallet will prompt you to sign a message confirming you wish to log in to Cielo.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Signing this transaction does not authorize Cielo to access assets in your wallet. Its sole function is to verify that you control the wallet.
{% endhint %}

Upon signing in to Cielo for the first time, you'll be prompted to connect a Cielo Telegram bot.&#x20;

If you are an existing Cielo bot user, select **Telegram Bot to** pair your Telegram bot with the Cielo web app. If you are a new user, selecting **Telegram Bot** will initiate the bot and pair it with the web app. When the Telegram app opens, follow the instructions to complete bot setup and then return to the Cielo web app and click **Continue**.

A quick onboarding tutorial will now start. This presents options for personalizing your Cielo feed and guides you around the web app. If you wish to skip this step, however, click **x**. You can revisit the tutorial at any time – and toggle light between light and dark mode – by clicking the wallet address in the top right to reveal the following menu:
