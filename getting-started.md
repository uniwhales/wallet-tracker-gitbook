# Getting started

To use Cielo, you require the following:

* Web wallet such as MetaMask
* At least 5,000 UWL tokens in the wallet
* At least one active EVM Wallet Tracker bot

If youâ€™ve already used the EVM Tracker Bot by UniWhales, youâ€™re halfway to mastering Cielo. If not, you can find the EVM Tracker Bot documentation [here](broken-reference) ðŸ‘ˆ

The relationship between the Cielo dashboard and the EVM Wallet Tracker bot is as follows: Cielo is designed to enhance and segment everything that the Telegram bot does.

#### _If the EVM Wallet Tracker gives you onchain powers, Cielo gives you superpowers ðŸ’ª_

**Note**: You need at least one active bot in order to use Cielo.

## Setup

Connect to the Ethereum network and, with at least 5,000 UWL in your web wallet, visit [app.cielo.finance](https://app.cielo.finance/) and click **Connect**.

Your web wallet will prompt you to sign the following message:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Signing this transaction does _not_ authorize UniWhales or Cielo to access the contents of your wallet. Its sole function is to verify that you control the wallet and to check it holds a minimum of 5,000 UWL tokens.
{% endhint %}

If you do not have the required number of tokens, clicking on your avatar in the top right of the Cielo screen will produce the following notification:

To fix this, go to [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x6a61cd16ec0c73b3855beecc4c378dcbdb63f88e) and purchase the required number of UWL tokens. Then return to [app.cielo.finance](https://app.cielo.finance/), refresh and connect again.
