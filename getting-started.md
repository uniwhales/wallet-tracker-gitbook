# Getting started

To use Cielo, you require the following:

* Web wallet such as MetaMask
* At least 5,000 UWL tokens in the wallet
* At least one active EVM Wallet Tracker bot

If you’ve already used the EVM Tracker Bot by UniWhales, you’re halfway to mastering Cielo. If not, you can find the EVM Tracker Bot documentation <mark style="color:red;">**here**</mark>.

The relationship between the Cielo dashboard and the EVM Wallet Tracker bot is as follows: Cielo is designed to enhance and segment everything that the Telegram bot does. If the EVM Wallet Tracker gives you onchain powers, Cielo gives you superpowers.

**Note**: You need at least one active bot in order to use Cielo.

## Setup

Connect to the Ethereum network and, with at least 5,000 UWL in your web wallet, visit [app.cielo.finance](https://app.cielo.finance/) and click **Connect**.

Your web wallet will prompt you to sign the following message:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Signing this transaction does _not_ authorize UniWhales or Cielo to access the contents of your wallet. Its sole function is to verify that you control the wallet and to check it holds a minimum of 5,000 UWL tokens.
{% endhint %}

If you do not have the required number of tokens, clicking on your avatar in the top right of the Cielo screen will produce the following notification:

To fix this, go to [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x6a61cd16ec0c73b3855beecc4c378dcbdb63f88e) and purchase the required number of UWL tokens. Then return to [app.cielo.finance](https://app.cielo.finance/), refresh and connect again.
