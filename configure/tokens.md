# Tokens

Click the [tokens tab](https://app.cielo.finance/configure/tokens) at the top of the configure page to add and edit Telegram bot alerts for token tracking. Cielo allows you to receive alerts for transactions involving tokens issued on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.



Cielo allows you to follow up to five tokens and to receive alerts sent instantly to your Telegram bot(s). (Pro users can track up to 10 tokens and Whale can track 30.)

To get started, click the **Add tokens** button on the [tokens page](https://app.cielo.finance/configure/tokens) and enter the smart contract address for the token you wish to follow. (You can find this on a block explorer for the network in question or from a market data aggregator such as CoinGecko.)

After entering the token address, select a chain, a minimum tx amount, and choose a Telegram bot to assign alerts to. Then click the **Add token** button to save your selection.\


To edit settings for a token youâ€™re tracking, just click the gear wheel icon alongside it.
